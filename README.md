# Solar-Powered Water Purification System

## Project Overview

This project focuses on designing a solar-powered water purifier optimized for use near oceans and rivers. The system purifies salt water and sends purification and consumption data to the cloud for monitoring and analysis.



## Key Features

- **Solar Energy Powered**: Uses solar panels to power the purification process, ideal for remote locations near water bodies.
- **Cloud-Connected Monitoring**: Purification data, including water quality, consumption rate, and operational status, is recorded and submitted to the cloud.
- **Saltwater Optimization**: Designed to efficiently purify salt water, making it ideal for coastal and riverine environments.
- **Data Analytics**: Real-time data collected from the purifier is used for optimizing performance and tracking water consumption rates.
  
## Components

- **Solar Panel**: Generates renewable energy to power the purification process.
- **Water Purification Unit**: A multi-stage filtration system that converts saltwater into drinkable mineral water.
- **Cloud Integration**: AWS or Google Cloud-based solution to store and monitor operational data.
- **Sensors**: Tracks water input/output, filter status, and solar energy usage.
  
## Data Collected

- **Water Purification Rate**: Monitors the rate of purifying saltwater to fresh water.
- **Consumption Data**: Tracks the amount of water consumed by users.
- **Filter Health**: Tracks filter usage to predict maintenance.
- **Solar Power Usage**: Monitors energy generated and consumed by the purifier.

## Benefits for Philips

- **Sustainability**: Contributes to Philips’ sustainability initiatives by leveraging renewable energy for essential water purification.
- **Scalability**: Can be deployed in areas with high water scarcity near coastlines, benefiting communities in need.
- **Data-Driven Optimization**: Real-time data ensures continuous improvement in the purifier’s performance, ensuring efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
